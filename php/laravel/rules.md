## LA-01
We should never include any sensitive information like password, access_tokens, username, payment details etc in project files. And hence should never
be committed to the git. They should only be added in the .env file.

## LA-02
Pass the data to config files instead and then use the config() helper function to use the data in the application.

Bad Practice:-

```php
$apiKey = env('API_KEY');
```

Good Practice:-

```php
// config/api.php
'key' => env('API_KEY'),

// Use the data
$apiKey = config('api.key');
```
